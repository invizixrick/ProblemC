1. In general I assumed that pet policies would follow the model of typical car insurance policies for a family.
2. I kept most of the table defintions intact.
3. I added a separate Policies table to track potentially multiple policies over time for any PetOwner along with a end date.
4. I added a PolicyPets associate table to handle the potential many to many relationship between policies and pets although it is not used by any of the deliverable sql.
5. I generally made identity Id fields the key with associated clustered indexes.
6. I generally added referential integrity constraints between related tables.
7. Specific changes to table definitions and deliverable sql are embedded as comments in the specific code.
8. I purposely did not denormalize the tables for optimized retrievals although that is an option to potentially see improvements at a trade off against space and inconsistencies.
